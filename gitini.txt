USING GIT:

Step 1: Go to your github account and create a repository with a name(lets say name of your project). We are creating a repository with the name myproject
Step 2: Make a folder with the name of your project and change your current directory to that  directory.

mkdir myproject


cd myproject
Step 3: Now we want to initiate Git for this folder

git init
Step 4: Now we will set up the remote, which tells git where the repository is located.

git remote add origin  https://github.com/your_username/myproject.git
